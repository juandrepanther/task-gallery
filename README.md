Test Task to create Carousel Component using Java Script (React library)
To run this App you need to:
- clone it from this repository;
- at your code editor via terminal run command npm i to install all dependencies;
- type npm start to run this App for evaluation.


Remarks:
- for adding free pictures has been used https://pixabay.com free API for further developing;
- API key is included in the code;
- for fetching data I used async await;
- Arrow functions, Conditional Rendering & styles;
- useState and useEffect hooks;
- for styles scss;
- Custom webpack with configuration without using automation like npx create-react-app;
- used Component with props;
- working at desctop and mobile devices;
- Support swipes (e.touches[0].clientX);
- Animated with finger-following swipes;
- Supports infinite loop (condition in the related function);
- Supports scrolling to a selected slide (Dots under images);
- No additional libraries;
- Code is absolutelly made by me and also included some comments before written code;
- Code was made by using one of the latest VSCode code editor without code Prettier;

Challanges regarding on Task requirements:
"Must work for any HTML content" - I understood it as Dynamical Images and code must be ready for any amount of images (I have done that), but not sure.
"Any optimizations related to performance are welcome and appreciated!" - Havent done, no practice on that yet.
"Supports multiple slides on the screen" - Havent done.

Thank you and waiting for response!
